# MatCal

**A minimalist, privacy-focused calendar for Android.**

GrapheneOS does not ship with a default calendar, so I decided to build my own solution while learning Android Development. 
The goal is a functional, privacy-respecting calendar that fits the system aesthetic.

## Privacy

All events are saved **locally** in a SQLite database handled via [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room). No cloud syncing, no tracking.

## Design & Theming

MatCal utilizes the system's **Dynamic Colors**, adapting automatically to your wallpaper and system theme (light/dark mode)

## Screenshots
